**Q**: Why is my Card Categories menu blank?

**A**: Your API key likely needs to be refreshed. To do so, log in to Salesforce and go to Handwrytten settings\> Account name\> Refresh API Key.  The API key is on your HW account under Your Name\> Integrations.

**Q**: Why is Salesforce returning my recipient address as not validated?

**A**: Please check the country code to ensure it is not missing from the recipient address.  You can opt to either send the bulk order without that recipient or update the information.

**Q**: Why is Salesforce asking for payment when I have Handwrytten prepaid credits?

**A**: Try confirming that you are within your monthly budget set by your Salesforce administrators.  The budget can be adjusted by your administrator as needed.
